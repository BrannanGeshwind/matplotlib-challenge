Repo for matplotlib challenge.

7/19: Submitting assignment as is, in order to not have it be late. Will resubmit with finished product.


Some code provided by TA Jakob, modified to fit variables:

clean_study_data_complete = study_data_complete[study_data_complete['Mouse ID'].isin(duplicate_mouse_ids)==False]
clean_study_data_complete.head()
